The first time I stepped on hashtag#stage, I was in my early 20s, standing in front of nearly a hundred professionals. It was a moment I had dreamed of, longed for, and prepared for with all my heart. But that dream quickly shattered.

I walked off the stage in hashtag#tears. Not because I was not ready, but because I hashtag#forgot my hashtag#speech.

It broke something inside me that day. But over time, I came to understand, not everything that happens is for a good reason... but sometimes, it becomes one. Whether it is failure or success, what you truly need is a balanced heart and a steady mind.

Years passed. I have been on many stages since then, speaking to hundreds ..even thousands. But that hashtag#first hashtag#stumble still grounds me.

Along this journey, I came across a story, one that has stayed with me.
A hashtag#young hashtag#schoolboy was preparing for his #100 hashtag#meter sprint 🏃 . Just before the race, he whispered a prayer:

❤️ “God, I am not asking you to help me win. I only pray I do not cry if I lose.” ❤️ Such a simple prayer yet filled with so much depth.

Life does not always give us the outcome we hope for , sometimes we hashtag#forget, we hashtag#fall, or we hashtag#lose. And in those moments, it can feel like everything is breaking inside. But true strength is not about never falling, but it is about holding your heart steady when you do. Like that young boy’s simple prayer, the real victory is not in winning every time, but in finding the courage not to collapse when life does not go our way.

…And for me, I still do not have that strength… but I am learning, one stumble at a time 🙏

Though I never fully understood why, there was someone at work who carried serious concerns about me long ago. He not only spoke negatively but also engaged in unethical practices that began to affect my hashtag#health. 

I remember sharing this with my wife, Sini. Her immediate response was simple: “Pray for him.” At the time, while i prayed for him but I could not understand why she wanted me to pray for the very person who was hurting me.

Later, I came across a story about hashtag#PopeFrancis during his hashtag#university days. One classmate constantly irritated and bullied him. Expecting guidance, Pope Francis went to a senior professor to share his struggles. After listening, the professor paused and asked, “Son, have you ever hashtag#prayed for him even once?” When Pope Francis replied no, the professor gently said, 

❤️ “Prayer does miracles. Your prayer has the power to change someone’s heart.” ❤️ 

Today, as I look back, I see the truth in that wisdom. I prayed for him, and through that prayer, I found peace with him eventually.

💜 Prayer is not just about changing others; often, it changes us first. 💜

I have often told myself I should get better with hashtag#MicrosoftExcel because somewhere I did not find a connection with Excel. I have been mocked many times for my struggle with Excel.  A couple of times I even promised myself I would learn it in depth. But each time, I found an excuse. “Too much work on my plate” became the shield I hid behind. Eventually, I even made peace with the thought that it is okay not to know.

Some time back, I read this story of hashtag#IndraNooyi’s from her early days at hashtag#Motorola. When she joined as head of strategy in the automotive electronics division, she was completely unfamiliar with hashtag#semiconductors and hashtag#automotive systems. Instead of accepting that gap as a hashtag#limitation and making peace with it, she did something unbelievable: she hired two professors from a local hashtag#university and sat with them every morning from 7 to 9 a.m. before heading to work. For nine months, she immersed herself in electronics and automotive basics until she could speak the language fluently and engage credibly with hashtag#engineers. She wanted to make sure that she was not seeing things from a 50,000 feet but able to add hashtag#value and hashtag#influence every hashtag#conversation. Over time, her ability to influence, advise, and make decisions grew immensely stronger.

I know its a shame even to compare myself with Indra Nooyi. She is an accomplished leader, someone who went on to build a billion-dollar business, while my struggle was with something as simple as hashtag#Excel. And yet, that is precisely what makes her hashtag#story powerful because, despite operating at such a high level, she still chose the harder path of hashtag#learning. That contrast hit me. Where I settled for excuses, she chose hashtag#discipline. Where I reconciled with “not knowing,” she chased “learning until she knew.” It’s a reminder that while we do not need to master everything, the areas where we choose to invest curiosity and discipline can transform not just our competence, but also the respect we command and the impact we create.

☘️ What makes leaders like Indra Nooyi different is their mindset. Where most of us accept gaps as they are, they see them as chances to grow. ☘️ It is a reminder that the difference between settling and leading often comes down to one choice:

 My view is, in general most make peace with “not knowing,” or do we push ourselves to truly learn?

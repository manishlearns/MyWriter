I always took pride in being a #multitasker. Got an #adrenaline rush juggling multiple things at once: switching between tasks, keeping up with the chaos, and feeling like I was in complete control. I even used to joke that I was like hashtag#Beethoven playing two keyboards at the same time, hashtag#orchestrating different pieces of work without missing a beat.

But reality has a way of hashtag#humbling you.

Long ago, I was working on a # high-stakes project that required both deep focus and rapid execution, analyzing data while managing multiple tasks simultaneously. I thought I had it under control until I did not. 

I made a mistake. A big one. And no amount of justification could undo it. The damage was done.

Shaken by my mistake, I began questioning what I had always believed about productivity. That is when I stumbled upon a study from the hashtag#University of hashtag#Utah that said only #2% of the world’s population can truly hashtag#multitask without a drop in efficiency, they are called “hashtag#supertaskers.” The rest of us? We experience 40% hashtag#reduced hashtag#productivity, more errors, and hashtag#cognitive hashtag#overload when we try to do too many things at once.

I even read somewhere that in hashtag#Japan, resumes mentioning "hashtag#multitasking" often get rejected. Their work culture values hashtag#focus, hashtag#precision, and hashtag#DeepConcentration over the illusion of productivity. 

I can not help but wonder have we glorified multitasking at the cost of true efficiency?

As an hashtag#introvert, I was always aware of my many limitations and implications because of that. I even believed that being an introvert meant I could never be an hashtag#Interesting person . For most of my life, I stayed away from gatherings. I also knew I was not the one people thought of when planning a catchup, and I never forced myself to join inbecause doing what did not feel natural only left me stressed

However What I could do, and do well, was be hashtag#interested in people.

If you look at my home library, you will  see many autobiographies of leaders, artists, and changemakers. I have always been fascinated by life stories  not just reading them, but reflecting on them, finding threads I relate to, and journaling my thoughts. Over the years, I began to bring that same curiosity into real-life conversations.

Whether at work or outside, with people whom i am able to relate to, I would ask people about their journeys, families, and challenges. And I would  listen  not just with my ears, but with my heart. I started noticing something: many of the most meaningful conversations in the office were not  about deadlines or projects. They were about kids, parents, struggles, and small victories. By showing genuine interest, I was not just hearing stories ,I was becoming part of them.

Over the years what I have  learned is  you do not need to be the hashtag#loudest voice in the room to be noticed. You do not need to work the crowd, tell the best jokes, or lead every conversation. Even as an introvert, you can leave a lasting impression simply by being hashtag#present, listening with genuine curiosity, and caring about what others have to say. People remember how you made them feel ,not how much you spoke.

☘️ To all my introvert friends: you do not need to be an extrovert to be interesting. Stay true to yourself  you can be an introvert and still captivate others simply by being genuinely interested in them ☘️ 

❤️ “To be interesting.. Be interested”... ❤️

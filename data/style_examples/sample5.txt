In the early days of my career, I experienced serious health issues that really tested my #strength and #determination. My parents urged me to return to #Kerala, and I seriously considered resigning. I was genuinely torn between continuing to work and going back to the comfort of home. The decision was weighing heavily on me, and I needed guidance.

During this tough time, I turned to someone I deeply admired and respected 
#MrUpendraKamath, then the #CIO of #Airtel. He was a man of great #character and a #leader whose wisdom we all sought. I shared my struggles with him and told him I was thinking about leaving.

He listened carefully and then spoke to me for about 20 minutes, encouraging me not to give up. He reminded me of the progress I had made at #Airtel and the #potential I still held. After all, I was doing well at Airtel then. As I was about to leave, he said something that stuck with me:

❤️ "Jai, you are meant to be an eagle." ❤️

A couple of years later, I moved on from #AirtelDelhi and eventually settled in #Bangalore. During one of those periods, I came across a story about #eagles that made his words even more meaningful.

Eagles are known for their ability to #soar #high and hunt with hashtag#precision. But what sets them apart from other birds  is how they handle themselves when there is a storm.
🦅 While other birds seek shelter during the storm, eagles rise above the storm, using the strong winds to fly even higher. 🦅 

That’s when everything started to make sense. I remembered what Mr.Kamath told me: “Jai, you are meant to be an eagle.” When life gets tough, I try holding on to that image, because while most birds fly away from the storm, eagles fly straight into it and rise higher with the wind. He may no longer be with us, but those words have never left me.
His message was simple: 

❤️ When challenges come your way, do not just look for shelter or try to escape them. Instead, open your wings, face them with courage, and rise above.. ❤️

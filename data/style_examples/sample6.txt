After four long days on the hashtag#ventilator at the ICU, one of the first things hashtag#appa (Dad) asked for was… a book.

I still remember that afternoon vividly , I was finally allowed into the hashtag#ICU. There he was, 80 years old, sitting upright in a chair, quietly reading. It felt hashtag#surreal. Just days ago, we were not even sure he would make it. Six broken facial bones, five shattered teeth, a fractured wrist, punctured lungs, two cardiac arrests while on a hashtag#ventilator and a hashtag#heart functioning at just 23%. And yet, he chose to read.

I wondered why. Maybe to distract himself from the hashtag#pain?  Distract himself from the hashtag#silence of the ICU? From the weight of his hashtag#suffering?. 

A few days later, he was shifted to a room. For as long as I can remember, he was a hashtag#voracious reader and he did ask me to bring a couple of his favorite books from home.  I had taken this hashtag#picture then unaware it would be one of the last we would have together. Within a couple of months, Appa left us for his hashtag#heavenly abode.

Recently, I came across a story about hashtag#Socrates. On the day before his hashtag#execution, he was found reading a hashtag#book. When his friend hashtag#Crito asked why he was reading a book?, Socrates smiled and said,

☘️ “Should I not use this time to learn something new before I die?” ☘️ 

And I paused.
Maybe… just maybe… hashtag#Appa was not reading that day in the hashtag#hospital to distract himself, like I had thought.

Maybe he was holding on to what made him him , his love for hashtag#reading, his need to keep hashtag#learning, even in his final days. 

A quiet way of saying: 
💥 Should I not use this time to learn something new before my time is over? 💥
